    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and easily maintainable backend for the Vibely application, prioritizing authorization independence and clarity. The key strategy is denormalization to avoid complex `get()` calls in security rules, ensuring atomic operations and easy debugging.\n\n*   **User Data:** User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}` using Path-Based ownership. This makes user data private and easily manageable with security rules based on `request.auth.uid`.\n*   **Channels:** Channels are stored in a top-level `/channels` collection.  `ChannelMembership` documents are denormalized into the `channels` documents using a map called `members`.  The `ownerId` is also maintained on the Channel. This design allows for easy querying of channels and simplifies security rules.\n*   **Messages:** Messages are stored in subcollections under each channel (`/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}`). This supports efficient querying of messages within a channel. The `senderId` is used for identifying the author of the message.\n*   **Attachments:** Attachments are stored in subcollections under each message (`/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}/attachments/{attachmentId}`).\n\n**Authorization Independence & QAPs:**\n\n*   The denormalization of channel members into the `members` field inside the `channel` documents facilitates Authorization Independence. Security rules can validate membership directly on the `channel` document without needing to `get()` the `ChannelMembership` document. This also enables secure listing of channels accessible to a user (QAP).\n*   Path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}`) for private user data supports secure QAPs as rules can filter based on `request.auth.uid` without further `get()` calls.\n\n**Data Clarity and Predictability:**\n\n*   Explicit path structures and field naming conventions are used to make the database schema easy to understand and maintain. Timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are consistently used across all entities.\n\nThis design adheres to all core design principles and strategy mandates, creating a robust and secure foundation for the Vibely application."
